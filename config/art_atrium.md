# 🎨 __Art Atrium Rules__ 🎨
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
> Greetings, Artist, Welcome to the Atrium! Below are the guidelines and TOS for this chat room in specific. If you have any questions about this channel or its rules, please feel free to DM/Ping any of the **@Curator**s for assistance.

1. **All server rules apply here**. Recall our code of conduct in the [Manual Page](https://discord.com/channels/164589623459184640/558136628590280704/563406038754394112).

2. **No use of generative AI**. We want to see fruits of labor and thought. Repeated violations will resort in disciplinary action.

3. **No Plagiarism**. If you're caught claiming artwork that isn't your own to be your own, you will be **Banned**, No exceptions. Just don't do it. If you're to post art that doesn't belong to you, make sure to write the artist's name on the post so that people may admire more of their work. If you lack a name, simply just state that it doesn't belong to you.

4. **Be Kind, Yet Honest**. Offer constructive criticism and feedback so that we all may learn and grow from our experiences. Excessive toxicity is greatly frowned upon.

5. **No NSFW, Borderline NSFW, or Nudity**. You will just be **Banned** if you violate this one, as it violates our TOS. This isn't the place for that type of art.

6. **Post Self-Portraits At Your Own Risk**. This is a public space, so be mindful of if you post yourself, as it will leave a digital footprint.

7. **Vote Your Favorites!** Praise what you love, so that it can be pinned in the channel. Pinned Fanart for TDT may even appear in some TDT videos!

**Stay Tuned, And Have Fun**! There will be, on occasion, community engagement events, to help give inspiration for those who want it. Enjoy the process of creating!
